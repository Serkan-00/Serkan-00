As a Software Developer and a Makers Academy Graduate, I have a strong passion for creating robust and scalable software solutions, using cutting-edge technologies and best practices. I have successfully completed an intensive four-month bootcamp, where I acquired a solid skill set in Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and gained hands-on experience in applying object-oriented design, Agile methodologies, pair programming, and Test-Driven Development (TDD) to various projects. 

I have also leveraged my previous background in IT support and hardware configuration, where I worked as a Service Desk Engineer at Harrods, to enhance my communication, teamwork, and problem-solving skills. I have demonstrated my ability to troubleshoot complex issues, manage user accounts, and work effectively in fast-paced and dynamic environments. I am eager to join a team of innovative and collaborative developers, where I can contribute to cutting-edge software development projects and continue to learn and grow as a professional.
